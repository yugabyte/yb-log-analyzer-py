    - Customer observed high latency on YCQL API calls but latency on yb-tserver was normal.
    - Latency was high on YCQL API calls because as leadership was not stable and found that leader was unable to advance the committed index across term boundaries as it was not able to replicate the NoOp to followers.

"Unable to pick leader":"""**Description:** This log message indicates that the system was unable to select a leader for a specific tablet. This situation can occur when the current leader is not available or is marked as a follower. If all remaining tablet servers are also marked as followers, the system is unable to select a new leader.

**Impact:** The client is unable to perform operations that require a leader, such as read/writes. This is because read/writes in a distributed consensus system must be routed through the leader. The system will attempt to resolve this situation by forcing a lookup to the master to fetch new consensus configuration information. If a new leader is elected or an existing leader becomes available, the client will be able to continue performing operations. However, until that happens, operations that require a leader will be blocked.

**Recommended Action:** Monitor the system for subsequent logs indicating a new leader has been elected or an existing leader has become available. If the situation persists, it may indicate a problem with the consensus configuration or network connectivity issues between the tablet servers. In such a case, further investigation will be required.""",
"Time spent Fsync log took a long time":"""This message is observed when the time spent fsync log took a long time. This could be because of slow disk or load on the system. If number of occurrences of this message is high, then we need to check the disk performance.

This logs gives additional information time like time spent at user level, system level, and real time. This can be used to identify if the issue is with the disk or the system. If the time spent at user level is high, then it is because of the application. If the time spent at system level is high, then it is because of the kernel which could be due to high load on the system. If the time spent at real time is high, then it is because of the disk.""",

Useful steps to debug this issue are:
- Check the PostgreSQL logs for any errors or warnings.
- Check the system logs for any hardware or OS errors. Look for OOM killer, segmenation faults, etc.
